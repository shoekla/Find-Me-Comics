# Find-Me-Comics<br/>
Find Me Comics, is the third project in the "Find Me" Series.
This web application lets users search fro comics, and read them just
like a comic book using bootstrap and turn.js. As for the back-end it uses flask and web scraping/crawling. 
Users can also create accounts to organize subscriptions for comics to get a more personalized feel for the application.<br/>
